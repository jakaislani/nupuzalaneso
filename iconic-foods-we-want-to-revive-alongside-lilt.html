In a world where exotic creations such as Space Raiders and Big <a href=#>Hula Hoops</a> hold sway, the simple honesty of a puffed potato couldn’t compete.</p><p>Now we can get crisps made from baked chickpeas – but where is the fun in that?</p><p>These were spooky flavoured <a href=#>Wotsits</a>, as far as I remember that come in cute little bags, unlike today’s shocking Santa sacks.</p><p>Available in a variety of flavours including tomato sauce they were discontinued in 2009.</p><p>There is still a lot of enthusiasm for these crisps online with many demanding their return.</p><h2>Cadbury’s Taz Bars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/7s7u4a2mdex61jpg-JS795689875.jpg><p>THESE little caramel filled chocolate bars used to feature the <a href=#>Looney Tunes</a> character Taz, (a Tasmanian devil, since you ask).</p><p>But we don’t hear much from Taz these days.</p><p>The old favourite was removed from shelves and the bar reintroduced as the <a href=#>Freddo</a> bar in the mid-90s.</p><p>Freddo is a frog – presumably the licence was cheaper, although I’m not sure I see the appeal of eating something that looks like a frog.</p><p>Bring back Taz!</p><h2>Rowntree’s Cabana bar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FB_IMG_15607735681721jpg-JS795688904.jpg><p>HOW could this possibly have failed?</p><p>Many of our favourite chocolate bars were invented in the 1930’s but this one looked a dead cert to freshen things up when it hit sweet shop shelves in the 1980’s.</p><p>It took elements of <a href=#>Bounty</a> and Mars, threw in a few chunks of store cupboard staple the glace cherry and dunked it all in chocolate.</p><p>There was a successful campaign to bring the Cabana back but its return was short-lived.</p><h2>Football Crazy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dj1c3TwXcAAb3zwjpg-JS795695201.jpg><p>THE food of our childhoods never fails to enchant us in later life.</p><p>This is the one that I pine for the most. I discovered these on a family holiday in <a href=#>Scotland</a>.</p><p>Frazzle bombs basically – a football shape dusted with bacon flavour goodness. They came in tiny packets that cost 5p.</p><p>Cheese flavour seems to hold a monopoly on all spherical snacks these days, but it was not always the case.</p><p>We were in a <a href=#>VW</a> camper with a top speed of about 45 miles per hour.</p><p>Cars have got better but I swear crisps aren’t as good as they were back then.</p><h2>Flyte</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sls_choc004-jpg-JS1984513.jpg><p>THE marketing department at Mars must have thought they were on to a winner when they imagineered these back in the mid-nineties.</p><p>They seemed to promise so much – twin bars of whipped nougat covered in chocolate and with less fat, too.</p><p>It was basically a two pack of Flake-shaped Milky Ways with a new wrapper.</p><p>Still, it wasn’t exactly <a href=#>diet food</a>. Maybe that was its undoring.</p><p>The fact it shared its name with the tragic hero of Evelyn Waugh’s classic novel Brideshead Revisited meant it was probably doomed to failure.</p><h2>Fruitang</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/download__1_jfif-JS795689974.jpg><p>WHAT a great name.</p><p>These chewy treats – along the same lines as <a href=#>Starburst</a>, Chewits or Fruitella – seemed to have what it takes.</p><p>They certainly did what they promised on the packet, pushing the tried and tested combination of tutti-fruity, sour and sweet to new heights according to fans.</p><p>But despite bringing in Nineties children’s TV favourites Trevor and Simon for the advertising campaign, it seems they were chewed up and spat out by consumers and were soon history.</p><h2>Panda Pops</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/msemail_jd_shutterstock_editorial_1140037ajpg-JS602704161.jpg><p>PANDAS were never exactly <a href=#>Top of the Pops</a> – there was always something a little bit second rate about them.</p><p>The Cola was not great – very sticky and sweet.</p><p>They were discontinued as competition stiffened – who wants a second rate cola when healthier soft drinks, exotic bubble teas and crazy energy drinks are readily available?</p><p>I have to confess a soft spot for the brand, though.</p><p>At least they made drinks that were a sensible size – a 330ml can is too much for a little kid.</p><h2>Spangles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Spangles-001jpg-JS80785251.jpg><p>THESE were a personal favourite of mine.</p><p>A pocket sized tube of individually wrapped squares with satisfying indentation which meant they’d stick to the roof of your mouth so that you could eat them undetected in class.</p><p>Not quite as bad as a <a href=#>candy cigarette</a> but basically, pure sugar.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>They first appeared in the 1950s and were available in single flavour packs with such enticing varieties as Licorice, tangerine and acid drop.</p><p>I was gutted when they were discontinued in the mid 1980s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e8Wopp1nYmaAeYSUbGxooZOku6qvjJ%2BmqJyjYsSmedaapa1lpKR6s7HVoq2eZZGhvK%2Bz0qKbnmWcnrm1ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ficonic-foods-we-want-to-revive-alongside-lilt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ficonic-foods-we-want-to-revive-alongside-lilt.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ficonic-foods-we-want-to-revive-alongside-lilt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ficonic-foods-we-want-to-revive-alongside-lilt.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ficonic-foods-we-want-to-revive-alongside-lilt.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ficonic-foods-we-want-to-revive-alongside-lilt.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./judge-joseph-wapner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./judge-joseph-wapner.html>Judge Joseph Wapner</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brent-spiner.html>Brent Spiner Biography, Facts &amp;amp;
