And though she was illiterate, she'd learned to keep track of complex amounts of information. These were all skills that any aspiring spy would do well to acquire.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Tubman had a difficult start</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the spring of 1862, Tubman traveled to a Union camp in South Carolina. She was ostensibly there to assist formerly enslaved people who'd taken refuge with Union troops, but her Underground Railroad work made it likely she also intended to serve as a spy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unfortunately, Tubman wasn't able to immediately start gathering intelligence. One problem was that, being from Maryland, she had no local knowledge to draw on. And the liberated people from the area mostly spoke Gullah (a patois combining English and African languages), which made communication difficult. Harriet would later remark, "They laughed when they heard me talk, and I could not understand them, no how."</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">She assembled a spy ring</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tubman took steps to bridge the distance between herself and the newly freed locals. Because they resented the fact that she received army rations while they had no such support, she gave hers up. To make ends meet, she made pies and root beer to sell to soldiers, and operated a washing house; she hired some formerly enslaved people to help her do laundry and distribute her wares.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tubman ended up assembling a group of trusted scouts to map territory and waterways; she also did some scouting herself. Having received $100 in Secret Service funds in January 1863, Tubman was also able to pay those who offered useful information, such as the location of Confederate troops or ordnance.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Tubman's information helped keep Black troops unharmed</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In June 1863, Union boats carrying Black troops journeyed on the Combahee River into Confederate territory. The usefulness of Tubman’s information was demonstrated when the ships proceeded unharmed because they knew where Confederate mines had been submerged. Tubman oversaw the expedition alongside a colonel she trusted, making her the first and only woman to organize and lead a military operation during the Civil War.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the raid, Union soldiers gathered supplies and destroyed Confederate property. In addition, Tubman had told local enslaved people that these Union boats could carry them to freedom. When signaled, hundreds came rushing to be rescued; more than 700 people would be freed (approximately 100 would go on to enlist in the Union army).</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">She was a successful spy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Combahee Raid overwhelmed the Confederates thanks in large part to Tubman’s espionage work, as one of their reports would concede: "The enemy seems to have been well posted as to the character and capacity of our troops and their small chance of encountering opposition, and to have been well guided by persons thoroughly acquainted with the river and country."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A Wisconsin paper wrote about the success of the expedition, noting that a Black woman had overseen the operation, but didn’t name Tubman. In July 1863, a Boston anti-slavery publication did credit Tubman by name.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">She continued her services</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tubman went on other expeditions, though few details are known about these, and continued to gather information for the Union. In 1864, a soldier noted that one general was reluctant to let Tubman leave South Carolina because he felt "her services are too valuable to lose," as she was "able to get more intelligence than anybody else" from newly liberated people.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Tubman was fully paid</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tubman was only paid $200 during the war. She did get a small pension because her husband had been a Civil War veteran; this was later supplemented due to her service as a nurse during the conflict. However, she was never paid all the benefits she was owed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It wasn't until 2003, after students told then New York Senator <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/harriet-tubman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hillary Clinton" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Hillary Clinton</a> about Tubman's missing remuneration, that Congress provided $11,750 — the amount Tubman should have been given, adjusted for inflation — to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.harriethouse.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harriet Tubman Home" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Harriet Tubman Home</a> in Auburn, New York.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyZq7a0wNJon5qqop6ytXnTrpmmmZ5ir6q7xquYqaCpYrOir9Os</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fharriet-tubman-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fharriet-tubman-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fharriet-tubman-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fharriet-tubman-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fharriet-tubman-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fharriet-tubman-biography-facts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kemeche-l-green.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kemeche-l-green.html>Interesting Facts About JaMychal Green Sister</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./did-eddie-levert-pass-away.html>Did Eddie Levert Pass Away?
