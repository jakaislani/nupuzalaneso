(Paqui recently <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that it is working with retailers </a>to remove the chips from store shelves. TikTok declined to comment for this article.)</p><p>Unbeknownst to his mother, Kyuonn grabbed a bag of the extra-spicy snacks — which mom had previously cautioned him against and sat right next to the regular chips — when they stopped at a gas station.</p><p>“Somehow he snuck it out of the store,” Cook, a machine operator at a factory, told The Post. She drove off, and three minutes later, both children began screaming at the top of their lungs in the back of the car.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The One Chip Challenge has been a viral sensation on TikTok, where the hashtag #onechip has over 160 million views and #onechipchallenge2023 has some 21 million. <span class=credit>Amplify Snack Brands</span></figure><p>“I turned around and started panicking,” said Cook, who felt completely helpless in the moment. “It was the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced.”</p><p>Both kids had to spend the night in the hospital to be treated for intense burning in their eyes, mouths and stomachs. Aarhiya also experienced respiratory issues and had to be given oxygen.</p><p>Cook blames social media for the terrifying ordeal.</p><p>“It’s a very dangerous thing and TikTok should be held responsible for airing these things on their platform,” she said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Harris Wolobah died after allegedly attempting the One Chip Challenge. <span class=credit>GoFundMe</span></figure><p>In recent years, several tragedies have been connected to viral challenges on the social media giant.</p><p>Last October, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg reported that the </a>“Blackout Challenge” — in which one tries to choke oneself to the point of passing out — was linked to the deaths of at least 15 kids under age 13 in a span of 18 months. This past April, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WGGB-TV reported</a> that 10 elementary school children in Massachusetts were hospitalized after trying “Trouble Bubble,” a gum that contains the same ingredient as pepper spray, oleoresin capsicum, and has been popular on TikTok. That same month, 13-year-old Jacob Stevens <a href=#>died after taking too much Benadryl </a>as a result of a TikTok challenge in which one takes massive amounts of the antihistamine. Earlier this month, a 14-year-old boy in Boston, Harris Wolobah, went to the ER and died after attempting the “One Chip Challenge”&nbsp;</p><p>Some grieving parents are taking legal action.</p><p>In October 2022, Michael and Shonell Green filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit in the Northern District of California against TikTok and technology company ByteDance on behalf of their late son Tate.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Tate Green was 14 at the time of his death.

He’d seemed perfectly fine. <span class=credit>courtesy of Mike and Shonell Green</span></figure><p>“We didn’t know about the challenge. I’d never even heard of that before,” Michael said. “Initially we had thought that Tate had committed suicide, but as we really looked at it. We realized how incredibly happy he was. This wasn’t intentional.”&nbsp;</p><p>The couple have found a shred of solace channeling their pain into raising awareness and hopefully helping to prevent some further tragedies.</p><p>“There needs to be some level of control or some management of the type of content being viewed by our kids,” said Michael.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The Green family.

We had an idea that he was using social media but it was never an issue,” Dean told The Post.</p><p>After Chase’s death, they learned that he had <a href=#>received more than 1,000 unsolicited videos</a> of violence and suicide about ways to end one’s life. Some of the videos were saved on his phone. One had suicidal messaging that read: “Player Tip: K!ll yourself.” Another TikTok had the message that: “death is a gift.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Chase Nasca was a star athlete who was loved by his friends and family. His father, Dean, says he’s trying to raise awareness to protect other children from the potential dangers of TikTok. <span class=credit>Dennis A. Clark</span></figure><p>“We were horrified. We didn’t understand why he would even have those videos. The bottom line is, these were unsolicited videos — he was searching for weight lifting tips, motivational speech, and they sent him suicidal videos,” Dean told The Post. “He wasn’t searching for this – nothing in his history indicated that he was searching for this.”</p><p>In March, the grieving couple testified before Congress <a href=#>on Capital Hill</a> &nbsp;about the potential national security risks and harmful content targeted by TikTok.</p><p>The Nascas filed a lawsuit against TikTok in Suffolk County Supreme Court in March, claiming their son was “targeted, overwhelmed, and actively goaded” into committing suicide.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">In March, the Nascas testified before Congress on Capital Hill about the potential national security risks and harmful content targeted by TikTok. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>“I don’t think TikTok should exist,” said Dean.</p><p>He maintains Chase had previously shown no signs of being suicidal. He recalls his son being excited about a ski trip he went on with friends weeks before his death.</p><p>“It’s not like he came to me and said ‘I really don’t want to go to [soccer] practice today’ or there was a decline in his grades or he wasn’t hanging out with this friends. There was not a single abnormality in his behavior that would even indicate that something was wrong,” Dean said.</p><p>“There were a lot of great things he was doing with his life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma2hfqbaswM6kZJygkaG5prrGnqpmo5mhuaawjKawZqOZmXqiusNmpaivXZ66brLIoJ%2BtoZ6ceqOtwqRm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftiktok-challenges-killed-my-kid-and-now-im-fighting-back.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftiktok-challenges-killed-my-kid-and-now-im-fighting-back.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftiktok-challenges-killed-my-kid-and-now-im-fighting-back.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftiktok-challenges-killed-my-kid-and-now-im-fighting-back.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftiktok-challenges-killed-my-kid-and-now-im-fighting-back.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftiktok-challenges-killed-my-kid-and-now-im-fighting-back.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./when-does-maria-georgas-go-home-on-the-bachelor.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./when-does-maria-georgas-go-home-on-the-bachelor.html>When does Maria Georgas go home on The Bachelor?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./prince-william-2023-fathers-day-portraits-7549134.html>Prince William Celebrated Father's Day With Two Never-Before-Seen Family Portraits</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./prince-william-2023-fathers-day-portraits-7549134.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
