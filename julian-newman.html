However, he’s likely in a covert relationship that he’d like to keep hidden from his professional life. If we learn anything new about his hidden love, we will post it here as soon as possible.</p><h2><span id=Julian_Newman-_Professional_Career>Julian Newman- Professional Career</span></h2><p>We can only speak of his career as a player in elementary and high school because he is still a 19-year-old student in high school. He used to play for the middle school squad after starting at Downey Christian High School in 2012. He had rapid success and was capable of hitting 91 points in a game. As a result, he was elevated to the school’s varsity team. He averaged 2.4 points, 11 assists, and 4.3 steals per game in his first three games. Downey Christian had a 21-6 point record thanks to Newman while leading the state of Florida in assists.</p><p>On the 19th of December, 2012, he received a promotion to the next class, and his average score increased to 17 points per game. He was featured in a story titled “Fifth-grader starting for Florida varsity team” on the website MaxPreps. His highlight video, which was shared on YouTube by ScoutsFocus, went viral and has over 3.5 million views. The fact that Newman was only in fifth grade when he made the varsity team drew global news, notably in The New York Times and Sports Illustrated. He began making television appearances on shows such as Steve Harvey, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Morning America, and others.</p><h2><span id=Fame>Fame</span></h2><p>He was rewarded by being invited to sing during halftime at an Orlando Magic NBA game. In December 2013, The Huffington Post dubbed him “The Best Sixth Grade Basketball Player You’ve Ever Seen.” He averaged 13.6 points and 10.5 assists per game during that time. The Tampa Bay Times dubbed him “the world’s most promoted 12-year-old basketball player” the following year. While his game and rankings were praised, several media sites had polarized viewpoints and criticized the headlines by comparing him to a child star.</p><p>He set a record as the youngest player to amass 1000 career varsity points in seventh grade. After the 2014-15 season, he averaged 19.8 points, 10.2 assists, and 3.2 steals per game. Julian started starring in his documentary series, “Born Ready,” which was posted to YouTube by Elite Mixtapes in 2015. On the 4th of October, 2016, he scored 52 points in a widely publicized match-up with top 2020 class recruit Kyree Walker at the Middle School Hoops TV camp. Newman’s highlight reel from the game has surpassed 10 million views on YouTube.</p><p>He achieved a new Florida prep record of 3,873 points, surpassing Teddy Dupay’s mark of 3,873 points set in 1998. During the 2018-19 season, he averaged 34.7 points, seven assists, five rebounds, and four steals per game. And, as previously reported, he is currently enrolled at Prodigy Prep, which his father founded. Julian and his family were featured in the reality show “Hello Newmans,” which premiered on the sports network Overtime in 2019. He’s also a part of his family’s sportswear company, Prodigy.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p><strong>Julian Newman stands 5 ft 7 inches tall and weighs 64 kg.</strong> Furthermore, he has Black hair and Black eyes.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Julian Newman does not have an official presence on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><ul><li>Julian was regarded as a child prodigy when, at the age of eleven, he was named to his high school’s varsity team.</li><li>As a member of the 5th-grade middle school squad, he could score 91 points in a game.</li><li>He holds the record for being the youngest player to reach 1000 varsity points in his career.</li><li>Julian surpassed Teddy Dupay’s 1998 record with a total score of 3,873 points.</li><li>On the invitation, he got to perform at halftime during an Orlando NBA game.</li><li>In a duel versus Kyree Walker, the top 2020 class recruiter, Julian scored 52 points.</li><li>On YouTube, his highlight films from his games have racked up millions of views.</li><li>He had his documentary series called “Born Ready,” in which he starred.</li></ul><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"For More Bio:&nbsp;Christina Cuomo Perpignano, Matteo Joel Nash, Walter Grady Roberts, Sophie Shalhoub"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1049089,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":14,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":40}{"1":42,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":58}{"1":60,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":80}{"1":82,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":14,"2":"https://popularbio.com/christina-cuomo-perpignano/"}{"1":40}{"1":42,"2":"https://popularbio.com/matteo-joel-nash/"}{"1":58}{"1":60,"2":"https://popularbio.com/walter-grady-roberts/"}{"1":80}{"1":82,"2":"https://popularbio.com/sophie-shalhoub/"}{"1":97}'>For More Bio:&nbsp;<a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Christina Cuomo Perpignano</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Matteo Joel Nash</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Walter Grady Roberts</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophie Shalhoub</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Basketball Player</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Juan José Lara Ortiz</a></h3>Juan José Lara Ortiz estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
