Located in Greenwich Village at 51 and 53 Christopher Street, this gay bar and dance club was enclosed within thick stone walls — remnants from its history as horse stables that provided both its namesake and a protective barrier from the outside world that was, on the whole, unsupportive of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Generally thought of as a “safe place” for the LGBT community, plainclothes police officers invaded The Stonewall Inn on Friday, June 27, 1969 (the same day as the nearby <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/judy-garland-london-concerts-final-years data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Manhattan funeral" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Manhattan funeral</a> of gay icon entertainer/actress/singer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/judy-garland data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Judy Garland" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Judy Garland</a>) and just after 3 am on June 28, things turned violent after a few LGBT people were arrested on questionable charges, handcuffed and very publicly forced into police cars on the streets of New York City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The LGBT community was fed up with being targeted by the police and seeing these public arrests incited rioting that spilled over into the neighboring streets and lasted several days. These events have been collectively described as a “riot,” “rebellion,” “protest,” and “uprising.” Whatever the label, this was certainly a watershed moment in LGBT history. In fact, many believe that the events at Stonewall sparked the modern LGBT rights movement in the United States.</p><img alt="Marsha P. Johnson Photo" title="Marsha P.

Johnson helped lead the 'Stonewallers'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The people who were at The Stonewall Inn and/or participated in the events at Stonewall in late June/early July 1969 are known as “Stonewallers.” Although it is unknown exactly how many Stonewallers there are (some project hundreds of thousands), many have publicly shared their stories and some are members of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.stonewallvets.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stonewall Veterans' Association" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stonewall Veterans' Association</a> (SVA).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/marsha-p-johnson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marsha P, Johnson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marsha P, Johnson</a> was at The Stonewall Inn on the first night of the riots. Many eyewitnesses have identified her as one of the main instigators of the uprising.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born Malcolm Michaels, Jr. on August 24, 1945, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Johnson moved to NYC in the mid-1960s. She faced many hardships as an African American trans woman and even lived on the streets until she broke into the nightclub scene and became a prominent NYC drag queen. An eccentric woman known for her outlandish hats and glamorous jewelry, she was fearless and bold. Whenever she was asked what the “P” in her name stood for and when people pried about her gender or sexuality, she quipped back with “Pay it No Mind.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her forthright nature and enduring strength led her to speak out against the injustices she saw at Stonewall in 1969. Following the events at Stonewall, Johnson and her friend <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/sylvia-rivera data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sylvia Rivera" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sylvia Rivera</a> co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) and they became fixtures in the community, especially in their commitment to helping homeless transgender youth in NYC.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sadly, at the age of 46, on July 6, 1992, her body was found floating in the Hudson River off the West Village Piers. The police initially ruled her death a suicide despite claims from her friends and other members of the local community that she was not suicidal. Twenty-five years later, crime victim advocate Victoria Cruz of the New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP) re-opened this investigation.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Stonewall Inn was declared a National Historic Landmark</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On the first anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion in June 1970, the very first gay pride march was held in Manhattan and since then, millions of LGBT pride marches, parades, picnics, parties, festivals, and symposia have taken place and June has been declared LGBT Pride Month to honor the 1969 Stonewall riots. Although the original Stonewall Club closed its doors in December 1969, the totally renovated Stonewall Inn reopened on March 12, 2007, at 53 Christopher Street. On June 24, 2016, the Stonewall Inn was officially recognized as a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nps.gov/places/stonewall.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Historic Landmark" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">National Historic Landmark</a> by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="President Barack Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">President Barack Obama</a> due to its association with events that outstandingly represent the struggle for civil rights in America. The Stonewall Inn is the very first LGBT National Historic Landmark in history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Stonewall riots were a tipping point for the Gay Liberation Movement in the United States. Its participants shaped a new cultural awareness of a population that was largely ostracized. Along with Johnson, who played a pivotal role in the initial moment of resistance that sparked the landmark rebellion, millions of activists continue to commemorate the events at Stonewall and fight for LGBT rights. Numerous plays, musicals, books, and films celebrate and honor the history of Stonewall and anyone can drop by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://thestonewallinnnyc.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Stonewall Inn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Stonewall Inn</a> to see “where pride began.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGifoqukpL%2B6ecKuo62topp8tMDOp5ywmZyherO1zq2qZqCZqMGwvthmo56ZlJq%2FtA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstonewall-riots-history-leaders.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstonewall-riots-history-leaders.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstonewall-riots-history-leaders.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstonewall-riots-history-leaders.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstonewall-riots-history-leaders.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstonewall-riots-history-leaders.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tofu-scramble.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tofu-scramble.html>Tofu Scramble</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./851843-randy-orton-to-co-star-in-new-movie-alongside-former-raw-guest-host.html>Randy Orton to Co-Star in New Movie Alongside Former Raw Guest Host</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./851843-randy-orton-to-co-star-in-new-movie-alongside-former-raw-guest-host.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
