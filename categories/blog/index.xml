Answer
As long as x=y is true, y may be used in place of x in any expression. The replacement property is more comprehensive than the transitive property in that it allows one to substitute x for y in y=z on any expression, rather than only y in y=z. The replacement attribute can be used just in one occurrence, as shown by its transitivity.
