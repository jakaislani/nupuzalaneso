<time>26 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><span><span>Black's strongest form was weaker than mastered SSB Goku in trunks saga. and <b>Broly powered up to almost ssb Gogeta level in a single fight</b>. Black dead or Merged Zamasu doesn't stand a chance, end result.</span></span><h2>Who is more powerful Broly or Goku Black?</h2>Originally Answered: Is Broly more powerful than Goku Black? Broly is way more stronger then Black could hope for. He has all his zenkais as well and he has all a saiyan natural transformations and is heavy competition with Goku & Vegeta post T.O.P .<h2>Can Goku beat black?</h2>The two fight evenly in the eyes of Future Trunks, though Vegeta determines that Black is overwhelming Goku. Black indeed does defeat Goku, but just as he prepares to fire a Kamehameha at him, Future Zamasu stops him as he arrives, recalling Black's prior promise to save killing Goku for him.<h2>Can Goku defeat Broly?</h2>9 Can't Defeat: Goku<p>Strong as he is, Goku's chances of defeating Broly are still very low. Fans think Broly is superior to him in terms of combat.</p><h2>Is Broly black?</h2>Appearance. Broly is a light-skinned Saiyan with dark eyes and black spiky hair reaching his mid-back with short bangs framing his forehead.<h2>5 Fighters Who Could Defeat Broly</h2><p></p><h2>Can a Saiyan be black?</h2>There are no African Saiyans.<h2>Why is Broly Green?</h2>Before Broly transforms into a Super Saiyan in the film, there's a mid-tier transformation in which he taps into the power of the Saiyans' Great Ape form. Without his tail, he's allowed to gain this power and still keep him humanoid form, and this results in his green aura.<h2>Can Zeno beat Broly?</h2>Dragon Ball's Zeno and 4 others can easily beat Broly<p>Although Ultra Instinct hasn't been matched up with Broly yet, he is unlikely to be fast or powerful enough to break through such a sturdy defense.</p><h2>Can Jiren beat Broly?</h2>Possessing strength equal to a God of Destruction certainly gives Jiren an edge in this regard—in the Super film, Broly was seen unable to land a single blow on Whis who had naturally achieved defensive capabilities similar to Ultra Instinct.<h2>Can Broly beat Goku MUI?</h2>In other words MUI is not for drawn out fights, yet Broly can surpass each previous state. So although Goku's reaction speed in MUI is faster than Broly's , Broly would have the power advantage and another in durability as well. Overall, I would say Broly would win.<h2>Who is faster Goku or reverse flash?</h2>By being able to travel in a dimension where time has been eliminated, Dragon Ball's Goku proves that he is technically faster than even the Flash.<h2>Can Jiren beat Goku Black?</h2>That means Jiren would still be able to outclass Goku Black by quite a bit. Jiren took on Ultra Instinct Goku, which goes far beyond the power of SSB. In the end, Jiren would beat Goku Black quite badly. Fused Zamasu wouldn't likely fare much better against Jiren either.<h2>What's the strongest version of Goku?</h2>There's no debate that the Mastered Ultra Instinct is Goku's strongest form as of 2021. It's established as more powerful than Super Saiyan Blue, Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken, and Super Saiyan Blue Evolved.<h2>Can fused Zamasu beat Broly?</h2>Broly is both the better character and the one who would win because Fused Zamasu was defeated by Super Saiyan 2 Trunks while Broly fought Super Saiyan Blue Gogeta. Its basically Super Saiyan 2 just ramped up to match Super Saiyan Blue.<h2>Can vegito beat Broly?</h2>Vegito would win because his base form alone appears stronger than SSJ2 and 3 Vegeta and Goku in a tag team and the fact that Vegito was the fusion of the two most powerful Z Fighters (Goku an Vegeta). On the other hand, Broly might win because his LSSJ form barely has any drawbacks and his power increases.<h2>Can Broly beat Gogeta?</h2>Although he doesn't have control over his powers yet, Broly is incredibly strong as he had no trouble in overpowering both Goku and Vegeta together. However, the two soon fused to become Gogeta and became strong enough to beat Broly without much trouble.<h2>Is Broly stronger than UI Goku?</h2>Again, Goku's Ultra Instinct is a level beyond Broly's Legendary Super Saiyan form and the former's strength rivals that of some Gods of Destruction. It wouldn't be wrong to say that Goku's attacks will hit a lot harder than Broly's and that's a key advantage to have in a fight against a monstrous figure.<h2>Who is more powerful than Broly?</h2>There is no doubt that in a Dragon Ball Super context, Goku is stronger than Broly. Here's why: Whether you love or hate the massive power-ups Goku and Vegeta have gone through during Dragon Ball Super, there has been one key theme to them.<h2>Which version of Broly is stronger?</h2>Both versions of Broly clearly have near unlimited power and strength. But Broly: BR's power level surpasses that of actual gods. Broly: BR wins in a landslide!<h2>Is Broly God level?</h2>4 God of Destruction Level: Broly<p>Although he hates fighting, Broly is incredible at it and his power level is so high that Goku and Vegeta, despite being stronger than they were during the Tournament of Power, couldn't defeat him together.</p><h2>How strong is Broly God?</h2>Usage and power<p>In the form itself, God Broly is strong enough to fight Goku in his Super Saiyan Blue form and base Vegeta at the same time, and at one point knocking Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta out when he was forced to get in the way of a blast to protect Bulma.</p><h2>Is Broly stronger than kale?</h2>Re: Why is Broly so much stronger than Kale? Because Broly's Base form is immensely stronger than Kale's presumably because he trains more and has higher dormant power. Also, while Kale's power increases during battle, Broly's power increases dramatically more so in battle.<h2>How strong is LSSJ?</h2>Strength: he is immensely powerful and can destroy planets with the force of his blows. He is the 2nd strongest being in the universe. Speed: he can travel immensely fast and can cross galaxies in moments.<h2>Why did Goku's hair turn white in Broly?</h2>Instead, Goku and Vegeta battled mostly using their Super Saiyan God forms, although there has been some speculation online that during one powering-up scene, Goku's hair turns the gray-white color associated with Ultra Instinct for a split second, hinting at the ability still residing deep within the hero.<h2>What is Super Saiyan 100?</h2>Super Saiyan 100 ( 超スーパーサイヤ人じん 100 Sūpā Saiya-jin Hyaku ) is the infamous fan transformation of the Saiyan race as well as the most powerful transformation in the Saiyan race if not the entire Dragon Ball universe. It's ridiculous and somewhat accurate concept led to its virality.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWafn6DCbq7EmqtmmqKkubp5waWYnKM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-goku-beat-broly-black.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcan-goku-beat-broly-black.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcan-goku-beat-broly-black.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcan-goku-beat-broly-black.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-goku-beat-broly-black.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-goku-beat-broly-black.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gonzo-the-life-and-work-of-dr-hunter-s-thompson-2008.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gonzo-the-life-and-work-of-dr-hunter-s-thompson-2008.html>Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S.
