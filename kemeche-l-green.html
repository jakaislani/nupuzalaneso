He exchanged his vows with his wife on&nbsp;<strong>April 22, 2011</strong>. Though his marriage was held in a private ceremony, the world knew about his wedding after he announced himself as a "happily married man" on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the NBL star's wedding details, nothing is out on social media platforms. As a result, his girlfriend-turned-wife identity is also behind the curtains.&nbsp;</p><h2>NBL Star JaMychal Is A Proud Father To Three Children&nbsp;</h2><p>In JaMychal's family, including him and his wife, there are three other members, his children. From his married life, the NBL star became the father of a daughter named&nbsp;<strong>Jada Green </strong>on<strong> September 17, 2013</strong>.
